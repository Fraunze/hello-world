# hello-world
hello . i am new to github.

My name is Frank Barry. I live in Cleveland Ohio. I have been teaching myself the art of "coding" for the last 6 months straight and i am eager to get to work on real life projects.
Anything that will help me hone my skills would be well appreciated, and i thank you in advance. 
I am currently skilled in the basics on the following languages: CSS, HTML5, SQL, and JavaScript. I am hoping to quickly jump to the next level and see what kind of carreer options are out there for me. :)
